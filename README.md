# TR2MTL Evaluation Dataset collection file
This repo consists of our created dataset of traffic rules and their respective temporal logic formula, specifically in Metric temporal logic.
Additionally, we have copied the English to linear temporal logic (LTL) as modified in work "Data-Efficient Learning of Natural Language to Linear Temporal Logic Translators for Robot Task Specification."
We used this dataset to show the effectiveness of our work, and it can be generalizable across choices of temporal logic.
